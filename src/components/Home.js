    <p> ACDS Teacher Surveys</p>
    <p> 2021 - 2022 School Year</p>
    <p> Welcome to the ACDS Teacher Survey landing page. On the following tab you'll find updated surveys for all the teachers at ACDS.
        The answers that they have provided are to aide in gift giving (if you so choose) around the holidays, birthdays or annual 
        teacher appreciate day in May. 
    </p>
    <p> ACDS has a very specific policy discouraging group gifting for teachers and staff. Please see the link HERE to read 
        the full policy. </p>
